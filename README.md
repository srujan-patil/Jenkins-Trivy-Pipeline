# Jenkins-Trivy Pipeline

This repository contains a Jenkins pipeline for automating the vulnerability scanning of Docker images using Trivy. Ensuring the security of containerized applications is crucial, and this pipeline helps in identifying vulnerabilities before deploying applications.

## Prerequisites

To successfully run this pipeline, ensure you have the following:

- **Jenkins:** A Jenkins server must be installed and running. [Get Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/).
- **Docker:** Docker should be installed on your Jenkins server. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- **Docker Hub Account:** Create a Docker Hub account to store and pull images. [Sign up for Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/signup).

## Pipeline Overview

This Jenkins pipeline automates the following steps:

- **Pull Docker Image:** Retrieves the specified Docker image from Docker Hub.
- **Install Trivy:** Installs Trivy, a powerful vulnerability scanner.
- **Scan the Docker Image:** Scans the image for known vulnerabilities and generates a report.
- **User Approval:** Waits for user approval to proceed with deployment based on the scan results.
- **Run the Docker Container:** If approved, the Docker container is started with the specified configurations.

## Usage Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the pipeline:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Jenkins-Trivy-Pipeline.git
    cd Jenkins-Trivy-Pipeline
    ```

2. **Create a New Pipeline Job in Jenkins:**
   - Open your Jenkins dashboard.
   - Click on "New Item" and select "Pipeline."
   - Enter a name for your pipeline and click "OK."

3. **Configure the Job:**
   - In the "Pipeline" section, set the "Definition" to "Pipeline script from SCM."
   - Choose "Git" as the SCM and enter the repository URL.

4. **Configure Docker Hub Credentials:**
   - Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Credentials."
   - Add your Docker Hub credentials (username and password).

5. **Run the Pipeline:**
   - Click "Build Now" to start the pipeline.
   - Monitor the output for scan results and user input.
